//Create a database called “StudentDB” in mongodb. ➢ Create a Collection named “students”.
➢ Create a Collection named “faculties”.

1. Create a Database called StudentDB
In MongoDB, you don’t explicitly create a database; it gets created automatically when you
first insert data into it.
But you can switch to the database first:
use StudentDB

2. Create a Collection named students
Collections are also created automatically when you insert the first document. But if you
want to explicitly create it:
db.createCollection(&quot;students&quot;)

3. Create a Collection named faculties
db.createCollection(&quot;faculties&quot;)

✅ Now your database structure is ready:
 Database → StudentDB
 Collections → students, faculties

Insert a single document into both collections name “students” and “faculties”. Insert
multiple documents(Atleast 4) into both collections name “students” and “faculties”.
Perfect �� Let’s extend what we built in MongoDB. We already created
 Database: StudentDB
 Collections: students and faculties
Now we’ll insert single and multiple documents into both.





1. Insert a Single Document into students
db.students.insertOne({

student_id: 1,
name: &quot;Ravi Kumar&quot;,
age: 20,
course: &quot;BCA&quot;,
semester: 3
})

2. Insert a Single Document into faculties
db.faculties.insertOne({
faculty_id: 101,
name: &quot;Dr. Meena Sharma&quot;,
department: &quot;Computer Science&quot;,
designation: &quot;Assistant Professor&quot;
})

3. Insert Multiple Documents into students (at least 4)
db.students.insertMany([
{
student_id: 2,
name: &quot;Priya Patel&quot;,
age: 19,
course: &quot;BBA&quot;,
semester: 1
},
{
student_id: 3,
name: &quot;Amit Singh&quot;,
age: 21,
course: &quot;BCA&quot;,

semester: 5
},
{
student_id: 4,
name: &quot;Neha Verma&quot;,
age: 20,
course: &quot;BSc IT&quot;,
semester: 3
},
{
student_id: 5,
name: &quot;Arjun Reddy&quot;,
age: 22,
course: &quot;MBA&quot;,
semester: 1
}
])

4. Insert Multiple Documents into faculties (at least 4)
db.faculties.insertMany([
{
faculty_id: 102,
name: &quot;Prof. Rajesh Gupta&quot;,
department: &quot;Management&quot;,
designation: &quot;Professor&quot;
},
{
faculty_id: 103,
name: &quot;Dr. Kavita Joshi&quot;,

department: &quot;Information Technology&quot;,
designation: &quot;Associate Professor&quot;
},
{
faculty_id: 104,
name: &quot;Mr. Sanjay Desai&quot;,
department: &quot;Commerce&quot;,
designation: &quot;Lecturer&quot;
},
{
faculty_id: 105,
name: &quot;Dr. Anjali Mehta&quot;,
department: &quot;Computer Science&quot;,
designation: &quot;Professor&quot;
}
])

✅ Now your database StudentDB has:
 students collection → 5 students (1 single + 4 multiple)
 faculties collection → 5 faculties (1 single + 4 multiple)

You said:
Display all available databasses. Display all documents in a collection “students”. Display
only name and course field in “students” collection. Display only name and department field
in “faculties” collection.

1. Display all available databases
show dbs

2. Display all documents in a collection students

db.students.find()
�� This will return every document inside students.

3. Display only name and course field in students collection
We use projection for this:
db.students.find({}, { name: 1, course: 1, _id: 0 })
 {} → means no filter (select all docs).
 { name: 1, course: 1, _id: 0 } → show only name and course, hide _id.

4. Display only name and department field in faculties collection
db.faculties.find({}, { name: 1, department: 1, _id: 0 })

You said:
Find Students whose age is greater than 20. Find students whose age is greater than 20 and
score is less than 80. Find all students who live in “surat” or “vadodara”. Find all students
whose course is BCA in the “students” collection.

1. Find Students whose age is greater than 20
db.students.find({ age: { $gt: 20 } })

2. Find Students whose age is greater than 20 AND score is less than 80
�� Make sure your student documents also have a score field.
db.students.find({ age: { $gt: 20 }, score: { $lt: 80 } })

3. Find all Students who live in “surat” OR “vadodara”
�� Ensure your documents include a city field.
db.students.find({ city: { $in: [&quot;surat&quot;, &quot;vadodara&quot;] } })

4. Find all Students whose course is BCA

db.students.find({ course: &quot;BCA&quot; })

Find all faculties aged 35 or older who live in Surat, from “faculties” collection. Sort the
results of the previous query by age, in ascending order. Find faculties whose salary is greater
than or equal to 30000 and less than 250000. Sort the results of the previous query by salary,
in descending order.

1. Find all faculties aged 35 or older who live in Surat
db.faculties.find({ age: { $gte: 35 }, city: &quot;Surat&quot; })

2. Sort the results of the previous query by age (ascending order)
db.faculties.find({ age: { $gte: 35 }, city: &quot;Surat&quot; }).sort({ age: 1 })
 1 → ascending
 -1 → descending

3. Find faculties whose salary is ≥ 30000 and &lt; 250000
db.faculties.find({ salary: { $gte: 30000, $lt: 250000 } })

4. Sort the results of the previous query by salary (descending order)
db.faculties.find({ salary: { $gte: 30000, $lt: 250000 } }).sort({ salary: -1 })

You said:
Find top five faculties with highest salary. Find faculties whose name starts with “S”. Find
faculties who are not from “Delhi”.

1. Find top five faculties with highest salary
�� Use sort() with -1 (descending) and limit(5)
db.faculties.find().sort({ salary: -1 }).limit(5)

2. Find faculties whose name starts with “S”

�� Use regular expressions:
db.faculties.find({ name: { $regex: /^S/, $options: &quot;i&quot; } })
 ^S → means name starts with S
 $options: &quot;i&quot; → makes it case-insensitive (so it matches S or s)

3. Find faculties who are not from “Delhi”
�� Use $ne (not equal):
db.faculties.find({ city: { $ne: &quot;Delhi&quot; } })

✅ These queries will help you:
 Get top 5 salaries
 Match names starting with S
 Exclude faculties from Delhi
You said:
Update a single document into “students” collection (ex:- age:25). Update all students
enrolled in the “BSC” course by setting their batch 2025.

1. Update a single document (set age = 25)
�� Suppose we want to update one student’s age to 25:
db.students.updateOne(
{ name: &quot;Ravi Kumar&quot; }, // filter condition
{ $set: { age: 25 } } // update action
)

2. Update all students enrolled in the “BSC” course by setting their batch to 2025
�� This updates multiple documents using updateMany:
db.students.updateMany(
{ course: &quot;BSC&quot; }, // filter condition
{ $set: { batch: 2025 } } // update action

)

✅ After this:
 One student’s age will be updated to 25.
 All BSC students will get a new field batch: 2025.
You said:
Delete only one student named “Bob” from the “students” collection. Delete all documents
from the “students” collection where the course is “BA”.

1. Delete only one student named “Bob”
db.students.deleteOne({ name: &quot;Bob&quot; })
 deleteOne() deletes only the first document that matches the filter.

2. Delete all documents where the course is “BA”
db.students.deleteMany({ course: &quot;BA&quot; })
 deleteMany() deletes all documents matching the filter condition.

✅ After these commands:
 Only one Bob will be removed.
 All BA course students will be deleted.
Do you want me to also show how to verify the deletion using find()?
You said:
Count the total students in the “students” collection who live in “surat”. Count the total
faculties in the “faculties” collection whose department is BCA.

1. Count total students who live in “Surat”
db.students.countDocuments({ city: &quot;Surat&quot; })
 countDocuments() counts all documents matching the filter.

2. Count total faculties whose department is “BCA”
db.faculties.countDocuments({ department: &quot;BCA&quot; })

✅ After running these:
 You’ll get the number of students in Surat
 And the number of faculties in BCA department
You said:
Create a database named “collegeDB”. Create a collection named “course”. Drop a collection
“course”. Drop database “collegeDB”.

1. Create a database named collegeDB
use collegeDB
In MongoDB, the database is created automatically when you first insert data.

2. Create a collection named course
db.createCollection(&quot;course&quot;)

3. Drop the collection course
db.course.drop()
 This deletes the collection and all its documents.

4. Drop the database collegeDB
use collegeDB
db.dropDatabase()
 This deletes the entire database along with all its collections.

✅ After these commands:
 Database collegeDB and collection course will be removed.
You said:

Create an index on the course field into “students” collection. View all Indexes of a collection
“students”. Count the number of students enrolled in each distinct course.

1. Create an index on the course field
db.students.createIndex({ course: 1 })
 1 → ascending order
 Indexing on course improves query performance for searches on that field.

2. View all indexes of the students collection
db.students.getIndexes()
 This shows the default _id index plus the one we just created on course.

3. Count the number of students enrolled in each distinct course
We use aggregation for this:
db.students.aggregate([
{
$group: {
_id: &quot;$course&quot;, // group by course
total_students: { $sum: 1 } // count students
}
}
])
✅ This will output something like:
{ &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;BCA&quot;, &quot;total_students&quot;: 5 }
{ &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;BBA&quot;, &quot;total_students&quot;: 3 }

You said:
Create an index on the Department field into “faculties” collection. Count the number of
faculties of each distinct department.

1. Create an index on the department field
db.faculties.createIndex({ department: 1 })
 1 → ascending order
 This improves performance for queries filtering by department.

2. Count the number of faculties in each distinct department
We use aggregation for this:
db.faculties.aggregate([
{
$group: {
_id: &quot;$department&quot;, // group by department
total_faculties: { $sum: 1 } // count faculties
}
}
])
✅ This will output something like:
{ &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;BCA&quot;, &quot;total_faculties&quot;: 4 }
{ &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;Computer Science&quot;, &quot;total_faculties&quot;: 5 }
